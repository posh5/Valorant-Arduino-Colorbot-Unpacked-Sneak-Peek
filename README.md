## Dreamz uses KeyAuth for its authentication. :flushed:
- It recently switched to hard coded auth through their server by literally asking people's HWID. :joy: -> Now they changed back to KeyAuth knowing how bad hard coded HWID authentication systems are and also their authenticated HWID list got leaked but I won't leak it here.
